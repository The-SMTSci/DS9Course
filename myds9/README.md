MYDS9 README.md
===============

Contains some hacks for adding to ds9.

SAOImage/ds9 has a few startup files.

It will look in the local directory where it starts, and in the home directory for a dsi.ini and ds9.prf files.

This allows you to have general "tune-ups" and those specific to the task in the working directory.

These were written over several years, usually quick and dirty to meet some repetitive need.
